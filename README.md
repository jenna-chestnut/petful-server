### Adopt a pet who's been waiting for their forever home! 

Petful is an app created to demonstrate a possible platform for animal shelters to allow adoption of cats and dogs. Potential adopters join our queue, and can watch in real time as pets are matched up with their new owners.

When you join the adoption waiting list, you'll wait until you are first in line.

Once it's your turn to pick, Petful will show you two animals - a cat and dog - that have been waiting the longest for their new family. It's then up to you to choose who you'll take home. (No pressure!)
